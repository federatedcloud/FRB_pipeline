On convertying palfa_calc_mi.c into python:

- mock_spec.h has hardcoded values that will need to be added to the python somehow.  We can hardcode for now, but will need to be inputs later.
- 3 functions: dedisp_smooth, calc_chandelays, and main
- In main:
    - Will need process command line inputs of files
    - will need file I/O
    - will need a parser to read 8 values: dm, snr, stime, snum, downfact, block, rms, and dmean  
    - will need to print error messages and output
    - the rest is calculations

In order to compile the C code:
gcc -Wall palfa_calc_mi.c -o palfa_mi -lm 

And to run:
./palfa_mi test.singlepulse /mnt/data1/make_dynamic_spectra_without_RFI/testing_datafile/raw_data_with_mask.fits test_MF.mi
